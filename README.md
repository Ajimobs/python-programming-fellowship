Welcome to Arewa Data Science Academy Python Programming Fellowship. This is a comprehensive, free program aimed at equipping aspiring data scientists and machine learning engineers with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the field. Strong understanding of Python programming will greatly enhance your experience in learning data science and machine learning. 

<!-- In this course, you will be comprehensively taught everything required to become a proficient Python programmer, including Python for data science and the fundamentals of programming. Upon successful completion of this challenge, you will be awarded a certificate of Python Programmer from Arewa Data Science Academy. Only those who completed the challenge will move to the next stage of the fellowship. -->

The course is designed to help you improve your Python skills through hands-on and bit size exercises inspired by the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. You will be presented with a task that will help you build better habits and become more proficient in Python. By completing these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of the language and be able to apply your knowledge to real-world problems. Remember, consistency is key, so make sure to complete each task every day to get the most out of this challenge. Remember, the only way to improve is to challenge yourself, so let's get started! Be active in our channel and ask question if you have. No dump question.

## Welcome to Cohort 3.0 ArewaDS Fellowship

Welcome to the Arewa Data Science and Machine Learning Cohort 3.0 Fellowship!. Whether you're just starting or looking to deepen your existing skills, our fellowship offers a structured path to mastering the fundamentals and advanced concepts. We've organized the fellowship into three main parts:

- **[Stage 1: Python Programming](#stage-1-getting-started)** - This part covers the essential Python skills needed for data scince and machine learnnig
- **[Stage 2: Data Science](#stage-2-data-science)** - This part covers data handling, from cleaning to analyzing.
- **[Stage 3: Machine Learning](#stage-3-machine-learning)** - Here, you'll dive into machine learning techniques and tools like Scikit-learn.


### Graduation Requirements

To graduate from the Arewa Data Science and Machine Learning Fellowship, fellows must meet the following criteria:

- **Completion of three stages**: Fellows must complete all the three stages to receieve Arewa Data Science and Machine Learning Certificate. However, upon completion of each stage, participants will be given certificate of completion.



- **Assignments and Medium BlogPost**: Submission of all required assignments and assigned blog post by the specified deadlines. Posts must meet the quality standards set by the mentors.

- **Attendance**: Maintain a 90% attendance rate for weekly office hours (Saturday and Sunday). 
  
<!-- - See [attendance list](https://github.com/arewadataScience/ArewaDS-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Stage-1-Getting-Started/attendance.md) -->

- **Capstone Project**: Complete a capstone project that demonstrates the ability to apply learned skills to a real-world problem. The project must be approved by the ArewaDS Team.

## Setup and Installation

The first part of our fellowship focuses on building a strong foundation in the essential tools used in Data Science and Machine Learning. We will cover installations, how to set up your development environment using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), including how to use Jupyter notebooks within it. We'll also dive into using a python virtual environment, Git for version control, GitHub for collaboration, Markdown and how to write Medium Blogpost.

We have provided detailed instructions, but you might not understand all the details of the setup for now. It will become clearer as you proceed with the course. So don't despair, put on your patience hat, and ask for help when needed. There's light at the other end of the tunnel.
